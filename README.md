The following image is the first alternative plot. In this plot the data has been sliced into different periods. The time period has been
doubled from 3 months in the previous plot to 6 months. The conclusion for this adjustment is the selling predictions precision has been negatively
affected by 50%. I do not recommend this alternative adjustment.
